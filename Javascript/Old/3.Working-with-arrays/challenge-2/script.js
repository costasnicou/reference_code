// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
// dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.

// Your tasks:
// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
// ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:

// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
// <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
// humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4


// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
// keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)


// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
// from other challenges how we calculate averages 😉)

// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// §Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// §Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

const dogAges = [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

const calcAverageHumanAge = function(arrOfDogs){
    const dogsHumanAges = arrOfDogs.map(function(age,i){
        const humanAge = age <= 2? 2 * age : 16 + age *4;
        return humanAge;
    })
   
 
    console.log(dogsHumanAges);

    const exludedDogs = dogsHumanAges.filter(function(age,i){
        return age >= 18;
    });

    console.log(exludedDogs);

    const avgOfDogAges = exludedDogs.reduce(function(acc,cur,i,arr){
      return  acc+cur;
      
    },0) / exludedDogs.length;

    console.log(avgOfDogAges);
}

calcAverageHumanAge(dogAges);
